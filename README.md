# Icestreamformation_SchoofMantelli_RSPA_2021

This repository contains the code used to produce results in "Ice Stream Formation", by C. Schoof and E. Mantelli, to appear in Proceedings of the Royal Society of London A in 2021.

The code can be run in 2 different modes: 

1. The routine run_divide_int.m calculates velocity, temperature, surface elevation and effective pressure for steady ice sheet flow lines with subtemperate sliding. It uses shallow ice mechanics. This code is used to produce output plotted in fig. 1 in the paper and fig. 2 in the supplementary materials.

2. The routine script_divide_runs.m calculates velocity, temperature, surface elevation and effective pressure for a three dimesnional ice sheet "strip", starting from an ice divide, and with perturbed basal along the full length of the ice sheet. This routine is used to produce all the remaining output in the paper and supplementary materials. 

Full output for the simulations plotted in the paper is available upon request.  Please, do not hesitate to get in touch for any questions/clarifications/.. (Elisa Mantelli, mantelli@princeton.edu or elisa.mantelli@gmail.com).
